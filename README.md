# DinnerTime
This is the project for Columbia University COMSE6998 Fall 2016, by Marshall Van Loon, Anubha Bhargava, Patrick Cao, Zoltan Onodi-Szucs.

<b>Description: </b>
We propose an application hosted on cloud services that infers the ambiance and styles of restaurants based off of user-uploaded images.  Our algorithm will process images on Amazon EC2 instances pre-trained with a convolutional neural network and return the style. The result will provide users with additional information that will aid them in selecting the right restaurant.
